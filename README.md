# MicroHeartbeat
A very simple graphical application written in Python which periodically pings a given DNS address, logging and timestamping results to user's home directory. The script may be easily modified to ping an address of your choice. Pings are sent in groups of five at ten second intervals.

Intended as a basic, user-friendly solution for tracking packet loss, server uptimes and what have you.
